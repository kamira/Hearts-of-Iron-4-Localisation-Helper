  such "protection" to any state that felt threatened by neighboring countries."
  solve "the mistake of the Versailles State." In a treaty signed by some of [YUG.GetName]'s most powerful neighbors, much of its territory has been divided between countries friendly to Germany.\n\nThis treaty was not even seen by [YUG.GetAdjective] diplomats before its ratification, but with multiple countries scrambling to seize Yugoslav lands from a collapsing central government, there is little [YUG.GetLeader]'s government can do."

  of "Murderers!" filling the air from bystanders. The mood in the capital turned dramatically in favor of the strikers. At nightfall, the soldiers retreated, leaving the barricades intact.\n\nThere have been no further attempts to force the situation. The strikers remain in control of the factories, and no work is being done."
  a "Social Revolution". Over the next hour, he laid out a system of reforms that touch every part of social life, promising every returning soldier an education, a well-paying job and a generous pension. He also announced a major building programm for affordable housing for young families, to begin the day an armistice is signed. This appears to have had a significant effect on general morale. Recruitment offices across the country report conscripts appearing and asking about options to extend their service beyond the current conflict, with others all but demanding a posting to frontline units to ensure extra benefits."

  within "the German Sphere," [From.GetLeader] in a speech today announced the [From.GetName]'s dedication to political and diplomatic cooperation with [CZE.GetNameDef]. With significant German-speaking populations, [CZE.GetNameDef] was presented as a natural partner to [From.GetAdjective] interests.\n\nWhile it is uncertain how much say [CZE.GetNameDef] has in this cooperation, they can at least rest assured that their borders are safe from [GER.GetNameDef]'s territorial ambitions."
  term "Worldwide British imperialism."\n\nWith tensions rising, the threat of a new British-American conflict seems far too real."
  calls "the greatest danger to human civilization, communism."\n\nNot only will [USA.GetNameDef] be pursuing protective policies to prevent the spread of world socialism in the Americas, but aims to destroy the heart of communism itself.\n\nWith the power of the [USA.GetAdjective] war machine, the utter removal of all communism seems - for the first time - entirely possible."
  named "the greatest danger to human civilization," communism.\n\nNot only will [USA.GetNameDef] be pursuing protective policies to prevent the spread of world socialism in the Americas, but the [USA.GetAdjective] explicitly aims to destroy the heart of communism itself.\n\nWith tensions at an all-time high, a single spark is all that is needed to trigger the fires of war between [SOV.GetNameDef] and [USA.GetNameDef]."
  power "between the seas."\n\nWhile the hope is to create an alliance stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, their stated priority remains to reinforce their position against threatening influences to both the east and the west. To this end, [POL.GetName] is seeking closer bonds with their neighbors in the Baltic."

  masterful "The Great Dictator," the esteemed actor was 'convinced' to come along to entertain the [GER.GetAdjective] troops stationed in the region.\n\nNow he is going to be sent to Berlin, where [GER.GetLeader] will finally get to meet his hero. While political differences risks putting a damper on the meeting, [GER.GetLeader] is awaiting the moment as giddy as a child."
  as "natural allies in the spread of the revolution," [AST.GetLeader] and [SOV.GetLeader] have signed a treaty that sees [AST.GetNameDef] accede as one of the primary members of the [SOV.GetFactionName].\n[AST.GetNameDef] has been declared a shining example of a worker's state, by and for the people, rather than the colonial overlords of Europe.\n\nWith the recent developments in [AST.GetAdjective] politics, some might say this move was inevitable. Nevertheless it is seen as a great cause for worry among those precise "colonial overlords of Europe," and any who are opposed to the unfettered grasp of communists and their World Revolution."

  termed "the Pacific Barrier."\nThe treaty has not been published by either country, so many aspects of their agreement are unknown. What is certain is that both sides have promised each other military support to "counter the advances of greedy outsiders in our respective regions."\n\nIt is too early to say what the world order envisioned by [JAP.GetNameDef] and [AST.GetNameDef] looks like, but there can be no doubt that [AST.GetFactionName] is now the dominant force in the Pacific."
  on "countering and containing immediate threats to both our countries' continued sovreignity." The thinly veiled threat does little to disguise the intention of hampering the military efforts of [USA.GetNameDef] on the American continent, and possibly beyond.\n\nPolitical commentators compare the situation to that of Europe before the Great War; two sides with everything to lose, and no way of easing tensions. The question seems less about who poses the greater threat to whom, but rather which side will be the one to launch a preemptive strike first."

  Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
